2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
PDRC-153#1 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net rx_handler/asignal is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin rx_handler/write_i_2/O, cell rx_handler/write_i_2. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PLHOLDVIO-2#1 Warning
Non-Optimal connections which could lead to hold violations  
A LUT rx_handler/write_i_2 is driving clock pin of 1 cells. This could lead to large hold time violations. Involved cells are:
write_reg
Related violations: <none>
