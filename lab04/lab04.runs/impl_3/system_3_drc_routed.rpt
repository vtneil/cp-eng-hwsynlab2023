2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
PDRC-153#1 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net pbL/sp/out_reg_0 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin pbL/sp/op_mode_reg[0]_LDC_i_1/O, cell pbL/sp/op_mode_reg[0]_LDC_i_1. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#2 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net pbU/sp/out_reg_1 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin pbU/sp/op_mode_reg[1]_LDC_i_1/O, cell pbU/sp/op_mode_reg[1]_LDC_i_1. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

REQP-1840#1 Warning
RAMB18 async control check  
The RAMB18E1 lut_calc4b/data_reg has an input control pin lut_calc4b/data_reg/ADDRARDADDR[12] (net: lut_calc4b/ADDRARDADDR[0]) which is driven by a register (op_mode_reg[0]_C) that has an active asychronous set or reset. This may cause corruption of the memory contents and/or read values when the set/reset is asserted and is not analyzed by the default static timing analysis. It is suggested to eliminate the use of a set/reset to registers driving this RAMB pin or else use a synchronous reset in which the assertion of the reset is timed by default.
Related violations: <none>
