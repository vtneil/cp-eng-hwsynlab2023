DPIR-1#1 Warning
Asynchronous driver check  
DSP vram_ra input pin vram_ra/A[0] is connected to registers with an asynchronous reset. This is preventing the possibility of merging these registers in to the DSP Block since the DSP block registers only possess synchronous reset capability.  It is suggested to recode or change these registers to remove the reset or use a synchronous reset to get the best optimization for performance, power and area.

Missing input or output delay  
An output delay is missing on led[7] relative to the rising and/or falling clock edge(s) of clk, sys_clk_pin.
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-18#33 Warning

An output delay is missing on led[8] relative to the rising and/or falling clock edge(s) of clk, sys_clk_pin.
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-18#34 Warning
Missing input or output delay  
An output delay is missing on led[9] relative to the rising and/or falling clock edge(s) of clk, sys_clk_pin.

TIMING-56#1 Warning
Missing logically or physically excluded clock groups constraint  
Multiple clocks are user generated or auto-derived on the source pin clock_inst/inst/plle2_adv_inst/CLKFBOUT but are not logically or physically exclusive with respect to one another. To have the static timing analysis match the behavior in hardware, there cannot be multiple clocks generated on the same pin and when such situation occurs, the clocks should be defined as physically or logically exclusive. The list of clocks generated on the source pin is: clkfbout_CW, clkfbout_CW_1
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-56#2 Warning
Missing logically or physically excluded clock groups constraint  
Multiple clocks are user generated or auto-derived on the source pin clock_inst/inst/plle2_adv_inst/CLKOUT0 but are not logically or physically exclusive with respect to one another. To have the static timing analysis match the behavior in hardware, there cannot be multiple clocks generated on the same pin and when such situation occurs, the clocks should be defined as physically or logically exclusive. The list of clocks generated on the source pin is: CLK_100MHZ_CW, CLK_100MHZ_CW_1
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-56#3 Warning
Missing logically or physically excluded clock groups constraint  
Multiple clocks are user generated or auto-derived on the source pin clock_inst/inst/plle2_adv_inst/CLKOUT1 but are not logically or physically exclusive with respect to one another. To have the static timing analysis match the behavior in hardware, there cannot be multiple clocks generated on the same pin and when such situation occurs, the clocks should be defined as physically or logically exclusive. The list of clocks generated on the source pin is: CLK_50MHZ_CW, CLK_50MHZ_CW_1
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-56#4 Warning
Missing logically or physically excluded clock groups constraint  
Multiple clocks are user generated or auto-derived on the source pin clock_inst/inst/plle2_adv_inst/CLKOUT3 but are not logically or physically exclusive with respect to one another. To have the static timing analysis match the behavior in hardware, there cannot be multiple clocks generated on the same pin and when such situation occurs, the clocks should be defined as physically or logically exclusive. The list of clocks generated on the source pin is: CLK_25MHZ_CW, CLK_25MHZ_CW_1
