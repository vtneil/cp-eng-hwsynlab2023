2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
DPIP-1#1 Warning
Input pipelining  
DSP vram_ra input vram_ra/A[29:0] is not pipelined. Pipelining DSP48 input will improve performance.
Related violations: <none>

DPIP-1#2 Warning
Input pipelining  
DSP vram_ra input vram_ra/C[47:0] is not pipelined. Pipelining DSP48 input will improve performance.
Related violations: <none>

DPOP-1#1 Warning
PREG Output pipelining  
DSP vram_ra output vram_ra/P[47:0] is not pipelined (PREG=0). Pipelining the DSP48 output will improve performance and often saves power so it is suggested whenever possible to fully pipeline this function.  If this DSP48 function was inferred, it is suggested to describe an additional register stage after this function.  If the DSP48 was instantiated in the design, it is suggested to set the PREG attribute to 1.
Related violations: <none>

DPOP-1#2 Warning
PREG Output pipelining  
DSP vram_wa output vram_wa/P[47:0] is not pipelined (PREG=0). Pipelining the DSP48 output will improve performance and often saves power so it is suggested whenever possible to fully pipeline this function.  If this DSP48 function was inferred, it is suggested to describe an additional register stage after this function.  If the DSP48 was instantiated in the design, it is suggested to set the PREG attribute to 1.
Related violations: <none>

DPOP-2#1 Warning
MREG Output pipelining  
DSP vram_ra multiplier stage vram_ra/P[47:0] is not pipelined (MREG=0). Pipelining the multiplier function will improve performance and will save significant power so it is suggested whenever possible to fully pipeline this function.  If this multiplier was inferred, it is suggested to describe an additional register stage after this function.  If there is no registered adder/accumulator following the multiply function, two pipeline stages are suggested to allow both the MREG and PREG registers to be used.  If the DSP48 was instantiated in the design, it is suggested to set both the MREG and PREG attributes to 1 when performing multiply functions.
Related violations: <none>

PLHOLDVIO-2#1 Warning
Non-Optimal connections which could lead to hold violations  
A LUT main_vga_sync/h_count_reg[9]_i_1 is driving clock pin of 27 cells. This could lead to large hold time violations. Involved cells are:
main_vga_vram_bw/main_vga_vram_bw/memory_block_reg_0_cooolgate_en_gate_33_cooolDelFlop,
main_vga_vram_bw/main_vga_vram_bw/memory_block_reg_10_cooolgate_en_gate_36_cooolDelFlop,
main_vga_vram_bw/main_vga_vram_bw/memory_block_reg_12_cooolgate_en_gate_39_cooolDelFlop,
main_vga_vram_bw/main_vga_vram_bw/memory_block_reg_14_cooolgate_en_gate_42_cooolDelFlop,
main_vga_vram_bw/main_vga_vram_bw/memory_block_reg_2_cooolgate_en_gate_45_cooolDelFlop,
main_vga_vram_bw/main_vga_vram_bw/memory_block_reg_4_cooolgate_en_gate_48_cooolDelFlop,
main_vga_vram_bw/main_vga_vram_bw/memory_block_reg_6_cooolgate_en_gate_51_cooolDelFlop,
main_vga_vram_bw/main_vga_vram_bw/memory_block_reg_8_cooolgate_en_gate_54_cooolDelFlop,
main_vga_vram_bw/memory_block_reg_0, main_vga_vram_bw/memory_block_reg_1,
main_vga_vram_bw/memory_block_reg_10, main_vga_vram_bw/memory_block_reg_11,
main_vga_vram_bw/memory_block_reg_12, main_vga_vram_bw/memory_block_reg_13,
main_vga_vram_bw/memory_block_reg_14 (the first 15 of 27 listed)
Related violations: <none>
